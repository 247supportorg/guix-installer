# System Crafters Guix Installer

This repository runs _automated CI builds_ to produce a
[GNU Guix](https://guix.gnu.org) installation image using the
**full Linux kernel** from the
[Nonguix channel](https://gitlab.com/nonguix/nonguix). If you are using a
modern laptop or hardware that is incompatible with the **Linux Libre kernel**,
this installer image is for you!
